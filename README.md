This project is not an interpretation of John Conway’s renowned mathematical theory called ‘Game of Life’ but instead is a parallelism drawn to the board game. This ‘Game of Life’ is a text-based role-play game that tries to recreate the real circumstances of life and teaches the user to take smart decisions in life. Unlike most text-based RPGs of the late 20th century, in this one user doesn’t fight enemies or show any acts of bravery. It is not a competitive game. This game draws out to reinstate a normal person’s life and is shaped by the user through the decisions taken in one run of the code(i.e. a life). Most of the occurrences are randomized, to make the game feel different with every run. It’s inspiration is quite vaguely drawn from the board game of the same name. This version is superior due to its dynamic interface that is easy to interact with, it’s user isn’t constantly forced to roll the dice as the randomness of situations are all handled by computational algorithms and it also creates an interactive environment (by the means of music and ascii-artwork) unlike the board game.
